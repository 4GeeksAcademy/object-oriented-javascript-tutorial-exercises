## `08` Create Simple Class

Right now, there is a Counter class declared that contains 4 functions: 

```txt
constructor: This function will initialize the value of the counter.
increaseOne: This function will increase the value of the counter by one.
decreaseOne: This function will decrease the value of the counter by one.
getValue: This function will return the value of the counter.
```

All functions are empty and your job is to fill them with the proper code needed to make it work as expected.

## 📝 Instructions
Fill the content of the class Counter to make it behave as expected.

## 💡 HINT: 
- Initialize a variable this.counter and use it in every function.

## Expected outpout

If your class behaves as expected, the output in the console should be:

```txt
1
3
1
```
